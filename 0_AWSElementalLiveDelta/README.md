# AWS Elemental Cloud

An AWS Elemental Cloud account will be required with a Deployment that consists of a AWS Elemental Live 2.11 and AWS Elemental Delta 2.1.2 Services. Though you could use the Appliance versions, the use of AWS Lambda requires these Appliances would be Public Internet facing. Please refer to Module 0: [AWS Elemental Configuration](../0_AWSElementalLiveDelta/README.md ) for more details.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of AWS services and a little bit of Python scripting. The understanding of why cats are adorable.

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account with access to create AWS IAM, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda and Amazon Rekognition resources. The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one student is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another student, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around these by appending a unique suffix to the resources that fail to create due to conflicts, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work.

All of the resources you will launch as part of this workshop are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. See the [AWS Free Tier page](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) for more details.

### Browser

We recommend you use the latest version of Chrome to complete this workshop. You may use the latest version of Firefox and Safari, but the video.js player may not operate correctly and you won't be able to play video.
